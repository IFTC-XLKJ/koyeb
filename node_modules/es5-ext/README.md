# es5-ext

## ECMAScript 5 extensions

### (with respect to ECMAScript 6 standard)

Shims for upcoming ES6 standard and other goodies implemented strictly with ECMAScript conventions in mind.

It's designed to be used in compliant ECMAScript 5 or ECMAScript 6 environments. Older environments are not supported, although most of the features should work with correct ECMAScript 5 shim on board.

When used in ECMAScript 6 environment, native implementation (if valid) takes precedence over shims.

### Installation

```bash
npm install es5-ext
```

To port it to Browser or any other (non CJS) environment, use your favorite CJS bundler. No favorite yet? Try: [Browserify](http://browserify.org/), [Webmake](https://github.com/medikoo/modules-webmake) or [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/)

### Usage

#### ECMAScript 6 features

You can force ES6 features to be implemented in your environment, e.g. following will assign `from` function to `Array` (only if it's not implemented already).

```javascript
require("es5-ext/array/from/implement");
Array.from("foo"); // ['f', 'o', 'o']
```

You can also access shims directly, without fixing native objects. Following will return native `Array.from` if it's available and fallback to shim if it's not.

```javascript
var aFrom = require("es5-ext/array/from");
aFrom("foo"); // ['f', 'o', 'o']
```

If you want to use shim unconditionally (even if native implementation exists) do:

```javascript
var aFrom = require("es5-ext/array/from/shim");
aFrom("foo"); // ['f', 'o', 'o']
```

##### List of ES6 shims

It's about properties introduced with ES6 and those that have been updated in new spec.
